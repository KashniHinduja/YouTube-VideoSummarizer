text = "the s23 plus and s 23 plus are basically identical other than their size . the bigger one apparently has slightly faster wired charging 45 Watts Peak versus 25 and a higher base storage there's 128 on the small one . the new chips are the Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for the s22s . it's the same general shape and design as last year flat display . the ports and the speakers at the bottom look basically the same . new camera systems are refreshed across the board new sensors new image processing new AI remastering of photos . it's a 50 megapixel main camera paired with a 12 megapixel Ultra wide and a 3X telephoto playing with it briefly . this isn't exactly new with some phones, but sometimes you take a photo of something fast moving . selfie camera 12 megapixels just a lot of new Imaging stuff here so that's what's new with this incremental s23 update . there's also a new 1199 s 23 Ultra again a pretty similar design to last year's phone one . the new pronounced rings around them have changed the shape of the sides to be much more flat, so the whole phone is just much more boxy . this was a reshaped curve at the edges to better optimize for the S Pen that is still here . but the battery size is still the huge 5000 William hours from last year and the phone is still huge . the phone feels like it's mostly for Aesthetics and feel in the hand . a new peak brightness of 1750 nits across the board is excellent . but the camera system is one of the biggest differentiators between the ul . the telephoto cameras 3x and 10x are going to be a bunch of new cameras to test in here . tra and the rest of the lineup aside from that it's going to be a pretty familiar phone to the one that I gave the best big smartphone award last year . still the know Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy you can get up to a terabyte of storage still the IP rating we already know there will be no Chargers in any of the boxes . this video sponsor anchor is Ace charger is definitely the move here this 313 charger is way smaller than Samsung's official one thanks to gallium nitrid charger for s23 Plus or anger Ace charger is the move .
